# Run lint-staged to check and fix staged files
# This will:
# - Run ESLint on staged .ts/.tsx files
# - Format files with Prettier
npx lint-staged

# Note: Type checking is done in CI/CD or manually with 'npm run type-check'
# We don't run it in pre-commit to avoid blocking commits for pre-existing errors
